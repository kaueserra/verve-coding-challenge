Thank you for taking our Data Science Coding Challenge. 
The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your basic programming skills in Python.
This challenge is not timed, so you can take it whenever you have about an hour free in your Day. 
Our expectation is for you to not spend more than one hour on this. Please send us your solution back within 2 days of receiving this challenge.


The challenge consists of two parts. Please ensure that your solutions contains

**Required**  
- Your Answer to Part One and Part Two  
- Runnable code to reproduce you solution
- Dependencies of your solution that we might need in order to run it, if any.

**Optional**    
- Document your code with comments wherever you find it necessary to helps the reviewer in understanding your logic

Challenge  
---------  
You are provided with a dataset. Your challenge consists of the following two parts  

--- Part One ---  
Find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.  
For example, suppose your dataset contained the following:  
```
1721  
979  
366  
299  
675  
1456
```  
In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299.  
Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.   
Of course, your actual dataset is much larger.   
Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?  

--- Part Two ---  
Find three numbers in your dataset that meet the same criteria.  
Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to 2020 are 979, 366, and 675.   
Multiplying them together produces the answer, 241861950.  
In your dataset, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?
