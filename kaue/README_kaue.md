# Verve Coding Challenge 


# # For Python 3.7  

### 1 . From the command line you point to the this directory 

### 2 . To run the script, there are two arguments: 
        - The first one is the file path you wish to test, i.e \dataset ,  
            you should either put the full absolut path or  
            the file inside this directory like the example below 

        - The second  argument is which part you want to try,  
            either you type part1 or part2 

### 3. Example of what you should type in the command line 

 - For part one with the dataset given
```bash
python kaue \dataset part1
```

 - For part two with the dataset given
```bash
python kaue \dataset part2
```
### 4. After this, it will print the results and also save it in a txt file with the endings according with each part 


### 5. Thanks for the Coding Challenge and I hope to hear from you soon =)
